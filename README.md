# Introduction:
A fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

# Analysis:
In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to analyze the dataset. The first step after cleaning the data is to filter the sales for the 3 promotions and then check if the sales for  the 3 promotions are normally distributed.

I decided to use the empirical rule to check how the sales for the 3 promotions are distributed. The image below shows the empirical rule for promotion 1,2,3 respectively.

The 3 image above shows the data are normally distributed and we can continue with the analysis.

To help evaluate the promotion that performs best, hypothesis testing will be used.

# Formulating Hypothesis testing:
Null Hypothesis: states that there is no significant difference between promotion one and two.

Alternative Hypothesis: state there is a significant difference between promotion one and two.

Microsoft Excel will be used to run the hypothesis test and the result is shown below.
